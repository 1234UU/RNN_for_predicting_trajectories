# RNN_for_predicting_trajectories
I use a RNN(specifically a LSTMs) which is used for predicting the next element of a sequence. Here, every time I train the network, I feed into the whole history of my predicting. 
RNN2.py is the RNN,
model 1-4 is for generating data,
test2.py is for testing the data.
