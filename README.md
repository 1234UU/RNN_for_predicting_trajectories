# RNN_for_predicting_trajectories
I use a RNN(specifically a LSTMs) which is used for predicting the next element of a sequence. Here, every time I train the network, I feed into the whole history of my predicting. \n
RNN2.py is the RNN,\n
model 1-4 is for generating data,\n
test2.py is for testing the data.
